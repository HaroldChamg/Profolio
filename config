# I have learned how to use Python to analyze data from csv file, which is what I always eager to learn from this class. 
# I am able to calculate my data, and show them in way of percentage, also I can use python to do some simple math for me.
# I might make my questions be more interesting and more diverse in the following project, since in this exercise my second and third questions are quit similar.
